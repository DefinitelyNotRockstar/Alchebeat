**Alchebit** is a game where you control an alchemist and fight against hordes of enemies only using your magical potions which you create collecting the ingredients that said enemies drop.

You are the last **Alchebit**. You kind has been persecuted by the **HighResWarriors** for the last few years. You though you were safe in your bit cave until they figured out a way to bit crush themselves and come to hunt you.

Your future is likely inevitable, but no Alchebit will ever die without a fight. Survive as long as you can!
